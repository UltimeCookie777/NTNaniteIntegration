No incompatibility for now just let us know if you find some (https://github.com/UltimeCookie777/NTNaniteIntegration)

Changes
We revamped the whole precursor system and """rebalanced""" every injections to work better with Neurotrauma (fractures, organ damage...).
Every injection costs 1 precursor (except Halesium wich costs 2).

You can now have every nanites at the same time if you are rich enough.

When injecting more nanites than precursor you will get different afflictions depending on wich injections you got.
